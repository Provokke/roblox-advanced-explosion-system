# Contributing to Roblox Advanced Explosion System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) - For syncing code with Roblox Studio
- [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create) - For testing
- Git - For version control

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-explosion-system.git
   cd roblox-explosion-system
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   rojo serve
   ```

3. **Connect Roblox Studio**:
   - Open Roblox Studio
   - Install the Rojo plugin
   - Connect to `localhost:34872`

4. **Make your changes**:
   - Edit the Lua files in your preferred editor
   - Changes will sync automatically to Studio

5. **Test your changes**:
   - Test in Roblox Studio
   - Verify performance impact
   - Check for errors in output

## Coding Standards

### Lua Style Guide

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for modules
- **Comments**: Use `--` for single-line, `--[[]]` for multi-line
- **Line Length**: Keep lines under 100 characters when possible

### Code Structure

```lua
-- Module header with description
--[[
    ModuleName.lua
    Description of what this module does
    
    Author: Your Name
    Date: YYYY-MM-DD
]]

-- Services and dependencies
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")
local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")

-- Module definition
local ModuleName = {}

-- Constants
local DEFAULT_INTENSITY = 1.0
local MAX_PARTICLES = 200

-- Private functions
local function privateFunction()
    -- Implementation
end

-- Public functions
function ModuleName:publicFunction(parameter)
    -- Validate parameters
    if not parameter then
        warn("ModuleName:publicFunction - parameter is required")
        return
    end
    
    -- Implementation
end

return ModuleName
```

### Error Handling

- Always validate function parameters
- Use `pcall` for operations that might fail
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Include fallback behavior when possible

```lua
function ModuleName:safeFunction(data)
    -- Parameter validation
    if type(data) ~= "table" then
        warn("ModuleName:safeFunction - data must be a table")
        return false
    end
    
    -- Safe operation
    local success, result = pcall(function()
        return processData(data)
    end)
    
    if not success then
        warn("ModuleName:safeFunction - Failed to process data:", result)
        return false
    end
    
    return result
end
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with multiple simultaneous explosions
   - Monitor FPS impact
   - Test on different device types (mobile, desktop)

2. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verify particle effects render correctly
   - Check lighting effects
   - Ensure UI elements display properly

3. **Network Testing**:
   - Test in multiplayer scenarios
   - Verify data compression works
   - Check for network errors

### Test Scenarios

- Single explosion
- Multiple simultaneous explosions
- Rapid-fire explosions
- Large-scale explosions
- Network-intensive scenarios
- Low-performance devices

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-explosion-system/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
